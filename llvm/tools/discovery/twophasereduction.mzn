% FR is the set of nodes in the final reduction.
var set of nodes: FR;

% FRc is the complement of FR (nodes not in the final reduction).
var set of nodes: FRc;

% FS[i] is the set of nodes of final step i.
array[final_steps] of var set of nodes: FS;

% FStep[j] is the final step of node j (or m if j is not in the final step).
array[nodes] of var 0..m: FStep;

% Last final step.
var final_steps: FLast;

% Count[k] is the number of nodes that correspond to instruction k in a
% final step.

% PLast[i] is the last step in partial reduction i (or -1 if the partial
% reduction is empty).

% Count[k] is the number of nodes that correspond to instruction k in a
% partial step (same across all partial reductions).
