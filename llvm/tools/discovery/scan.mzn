%%% AUXILIARY DEFINITIONS

% Upper bound on number of scan steps.
int: m = n;

% Set of potential scan steps.
set of int: steps = 0..m-1;

%%% VARIABLES

% SC is the set of nodes in the scan pattern.
var set of nodes: SC;

% SCc is the complement of SC (nodes not in the scan pattern).
var set of nodes: SCc;

% S[i] is the set of nodes of step i in the scan.
array[steps] of var set of nodes: S;

% Step[j] is the step of node j (or m if j does not belong to SC).
array[nodes] of var 0..m: Step;

% Last step in the scan.
var steps: Last;

% Count[k] is the number of nodes that correspond to instruction k in a
% scan step.
%
% These variables and the corresponding constraints enforce, by construction,
% that all steps contain the same number of nodes and cover the same
% instructions the same number of times. This is an approximation to step
% isomorphism, which is doable but would add a lot of model overhead (the
% isomorphism bijection would have to be modeled explicitly, as there are no
% global constraints available).
array[insts] of var 0..n: Count;

%%% CONSTRAINTS

% Ensure that SC contains only matchable nodes.
constraint SC subset matchable;

% Ensure that SC and SCc are complementary.
constraint partition_set([SC, SCc], nodes);

% Ensure that the scan steps form a partition of SC.
constraint partition_set(S ++ [SCc], nodes);

% Ensure that the step of a node j is set to i if j in S[i], or to m otherwise.
% FIXME: use one-based numbering from the beginning?
constraint int_set_channel_zero(Step, S ++ [SCc]);

% Ensure that the last step is non-empty and has an empty successor step.
constraint last_non_empty(Last, S);

% Ensure that all steps form a chain. This is enforced by 1) ensuring each arc
% in the DDG is either external, incoming, intra-step, inter-step, or outgoing;
